# ML-Car-Price-Prediction-Project
This project is a Flask web application for predicting the price of used cars. It uses a linear regression model trained on a dataset of car attributes like company, model, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. The model is loaded from a pickle file. The user can select the car's company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven through a form on the web page. Upon submission, the model predicts the price of the car, and the result is displayed. CORS is implemented for cross-origin resource sharing.
